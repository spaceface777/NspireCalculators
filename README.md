# Nspire Calculators

## INTRODUCTION
This repo contains the code for my custom calculators for the TI Nspire CX. (It should work on other models, but it hasn't been tested). 

## DISCLAIMER
By purchasing / installing these calculators, you are effectively becoming the owner of the file. If you receive any consequences for using them, then it is in NO WAY my fault. 

## INSTALLATION
All code is saved in this repository. If you can figure out how to install it yourself, then good for you! If not, then you can 

## PURCHASING
You can buy the calculators by [filling in this form](https://goo.gl/forms/hrhIV5CWMWb9MRYg2 "Calculator request form"). The prices are the following:

## ISSUES / REQUESTS

If you find any problem with an existing calculator, or want to request a new one, create an entry in [the Issues page](https://github.com/spaceface777/NspireCalculators/issues "Issues page"), and <b>please</b> follow the template on the page. When I code a fix, I will post the updated code here and install the update manually if you purchased that option.
